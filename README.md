# webrtc-builder
This is a simple script that does the necessary steps to build the webrtc native code based on the instructions mentioned [here](https://webrtc.org/native-code/development/).

# running the script
Just run this command. 

`curl --silent --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayakzob/webrtc-builder/master/build.sh | sh -`

The build process takes a good amount of time so be patient. (1~2 hours in a decent computer)
