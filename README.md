# webrtc-builder
This is a simple script that does the necessary steps to build the webrtc native code based on the instructions mentioned [here](https://webrtc.org/native-code/development/).

# running the script
Just run this command. `curl --silent --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayakzob/webrtc-builder/master/build.sh | sh -`

If you are not using apt-get update the git installation line

If you want to create qt creator project files update "gn gen out/Debug" line

The build process takes a good amount of time so be patient. (~2 hours in a decent computer)
